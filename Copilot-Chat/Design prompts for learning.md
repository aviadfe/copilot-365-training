# Design prompts for learning

Educators can take full advantage of the power of Copilot Chat by crafting good prompts. When writing prompts, consider the following tips. 

- **Define clear objectives.** Determine the main goal of the prompt and the role AI should take. Whether you’re creating a syllabus, drafting a quiz, or revising lesson content, have a clear vision of the end goal. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
- **Be specific.** Copilot Chat experiences work best when you give detailed instructions. Specify the grade level, subject, topic, or any other relevant parameters. For example, "secondary math quiz on algebraic expressions" is clearer than "math quiz."
- **Structure the prompt.** Break complex tasks into smaller parts. Instead of asking the AI to draft an entire lesson, request an outline, then delve into specific sections.
- **Iterate and refine.** The first response from AI might not always align perfectly with expectations. Don’t hesitate to rephrase the prompt, ask follow-up questions, or provide more context based on the initial output.

- **Combine expertise.** Use AI as a tool to enhance and streamline work, but remember to overlay its suggestions with your educational expertise. AI can suggest content, but the educator decides the best way to edit and present it to their audience.

**Tip:**  
Consider using a polite tone when interacting with AI. The generative responses mirror professionalism, clarity, detail, and even etiquette. Start prompts with “please” to ensure the AI response is respectful and collaborative.

## Create an assignment and rubric

AI has the potential to save educators time on many tasks. One example is creating an assignment description and scoring rubric. Using an assistant to kickstart a rubric for an assignment is a great way to develop a sample that the educator can modify to best fit the learners’ task.

### Sample prompt #1

First, give clear objectives. Include the role AI should play in delivering the response. Be specific about the topic.

#### Sample prompt

> Respond as a secondary history teacher. The learners will write an essay on "The Impact of World War II on Modern Society." Write the assignment details for the learners.

#### Sample response

### Sample prompt #2

Next, the educator might want to create a rubric for this assignment. They can continue the conversation with Copilot Chat by adding information and their own expertise. Beginning the prompt with a verb like "Create a rubric…" guides Copilot Chat to develop a new rubric in the response.

#### Add the following text in the same chat

> Create a rubric for this project. The learners will be exploring political, social, and economic changes post-war.
#### Sample response

### Sample prompt #3

In the next iteration, the educator might include categories for the rubric to structure the response. They might specifically ask for a downloadable format like a table.

Add the following text in the same chat:

> Create a rubric for this project in a table so I can download it. Organize the rubric with columns for the category, description, and point value. Include categories for thesis clarity, use of historical evidence, essay organization, grammar and mechanics, and critical thinking. The rubric should total 100 points and place an emphasis in the critical thinking component.

## Copilot Chat can do more

Copilot Chat can also help with coding and related topics. It can:

- Review code
- Test for errors
- Find bugs
- Suggest solutions

On certain prompts, Copilot Chat outputs code for the scenario. Use the tool carefully and appropriately for your experience. Use discretion and carefully review and test the code for issues, like errors, bugs, and vulnerabilities, before using it. Also review the code to ensure it complies with the source license compliance obligations. If you're aware of any obligations, take steps to comply with the license requirements to the extent applicable and relevant to the situation.

Another application of Copilot Chat in teaching and learning is translation. Add content into the prompt space, then tell Copilot Chat which language to translate into. This process uses online translation engines to produce a new version of the text. *(Sample link available on page)*

These examples are just the beginning of what’s possible with Copilot Chat. Create your own prompts that best support teaching tasks.
