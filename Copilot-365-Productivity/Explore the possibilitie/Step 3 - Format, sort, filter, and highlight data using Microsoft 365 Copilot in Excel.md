# Format, sort, filter, and highlight data using Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel

With Microsoft 365 Copilot in Excel, it's easy to highlight, sort, and
filter your tables to quickly call attention to what matters to you.
Using a single table in Excel, you can have Copilot effortlessly:

-   Sort and filter your data.
-   Apply simple conditional formatting.

To get started, format your data in a [supported format](https://support.microsoft.com) and select the Copilot button in the ribbon. Then, tell Copilot how you'd like to manipulate the table to better view portions of your data.


## Let's get crafting

First, download **Fabrikam Q1 marketing campaigns.xlsx** and save the
file to your OneDrive folder if you haven't yet done so.

Open the spreadsheet in Excel and then open the Copilot pane by
selecting the Copilot icon in the ribbon's Home tab. Enter the prompts
below and follow along.

> **Note:**\
> Starting prompt:\
> `Sort this table.`
>
> In this simple prompt, you start with the basic Goal: to sort and
> filter an Excel table. However, there's no indication how you want the
> data sorted and which field you want to filter.


### Prompt examples

| Prompt Element | Example |
| -------------- | ------- |
| **Basic prompt:** | Start with a Goal `Sort this table...` |
| **Good prompt:** | Add Context — help Copilot understand what the table is for and what topic to focus on |
| **Better prompt:** | Specify Source(s) — “this table [Table1]...” |
| **Best prompt:** | Set clear Expectations — “and highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue” |
| **Crafted prompt:** | `Sort this table [Table1] to look for the most impactful salesperson and highlight the top and bottom campaign owners based off of net revenue` | :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

This prompt requires multiple steps to execute, a prompting technique called chaining where you ask Copilot to perform sequential, back-to-back commands to achieve a single goal. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

    Sort this table [Table1] to look for the most impactful salesperson.

the Goal, Context, Source, and Expectations in this prompt.
